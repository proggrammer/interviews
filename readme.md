Objective:

Minimum number of coding+DS+Algo problems code in Java.

Topics are:

A. Coding problems : Threads, Java related DS, Exception problems.

B. Problem Solving - DS algo problems - examples are - Greedy, Dynamic, binary search, divide and conquer, backtracking, graph traversal etc.

A. Coding problems : Threads, Java related DS, Exception problems.

==================================================================

Exceptions:

    1. Utilize a Checked Exception within a lambda expression to propagate the same checked exception. The concern arises due to the conversion to a Runtime Exception inside the lambda expression.

    2. Example of unchecked exceptions to checked Exception.


Async:

    1. Combine multiple async method calls - combine their result in Java.


Custom Data Structures in Java:

    1. Develop a custom Java map with composite keys, consisting of two individual keys.

    2. Develop a java custom map whose values can be a a terminal data type in java or a map - kind of nested map.

    3. Implement Stack in Java.


Thread:

    1. Develop a Java program with three threads: the first thread prints odd integers, the second thread prints even integers, and the third thread prints delimiters. Ensure synchronization so that the program prints integers from 1 to n with appropriate delimiters.


Miscellaneous:

    1. Build a Java task scheduler that, in case of task failure, reschedules it a finite number of times while progressively increasing the waiting time for each reschedule exponentially.
    2. JSon to nested Map, nested map to un-nested (flattened) map, flattened Map to json.
    3. File Read & write
    4. STDIn-STDOut - read write.
    5. Compress-decompress String - example aaabb -> a3b2
    6. LRU cache.

B. Problem Solving - DS algo problems - examples are - Greedy, Dynamic, binary search, divide and conquer, backtracking, graph traversal etc.

====================================================================

Binary Search:

    1. Find Peak Element
    2. Rotated sorted array - search for lowest number & search for a number.
Stack:

    1. Arithmatic expression evaluator

BST:

    1. BST Serialisation-deserialisation

Backtracking:

    1. 8 queen problem - arrange 8 queens so that all are safe.
    2. All Permutation of a string.
    
Dynamic program:

    1. Longest common subsequence.

Graph/Tree traversal:

    1. From top left corner to bottom right corner in a binary matrix avoiding 1 cell with 4 neighbourhood - get the shortest path - print length and print path.
    2. Finding Largest Island in a binary matrix with 1 representing land, and 0 water.
    3. Tree BFS & iterative & max finding.
    4. Tree DFS & iterative & max finding.
    5. BFS graph.
    6. DFS Graph.

Matrix:

    1. Rotate a matrix by 90 degree right and left.

Sorting:

    1. Merge Sort
    2. Count inversion in an array.
    3. Almost sorted array - the elements are max at k distance from where it should be.

Plane Sweep Algo:
    
    1. Largest area in histogram
