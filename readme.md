Objective:

Minimum number of coding+DS+Algo problems code in Java.

Topics are:

A. Coding problems : Threads, Java related DS, Exception problems.

B. Problem Solving - DS algo problems - examples are - Greedy, Dynamic, binary search, divide and conquer, backtracking, graph traversal etc.

A. Coding problems : Threads, Java related DS, Exception problems.

==================================================================

Exceptions:

    1. Utilize a Checked Exception within a lambda expression to propagate the same checked exception. The concern arises due to the conversion to a Runtime Exception inside the lambda expression.

    2. Example of unchecked exceptions to checked Exception.


Async:

    1. Combine multiple async method calls - combine their result in Java.


Custom Data Structures in Java:

    1. Develop a custom Java map with composite keys, consisting of two individual keys.

    2. Develop a java custom map whose values can be a a terminal data type in java or a map - kind of nested map.

    3. Implement Stack in Java.


Thread:

    1. Develop a Java program with three threads: the first thread prints odd integers, the second thread prints even integers, and the third thread prints delimiters. Ensure synchronization so that the program prints integers from 1 to n with appropriate delimiters.


Priority Queue:

    1. Build a Java task scheduler that, in case of task failure, reschedules it a finite number of times while progressively increasing the waiting time for each reschedule exponentially.


B. Problem Solving - DS algo problems - examples are - Greedy, Dynamic, binary search, divide and conquer, backtracking, graph traversal etc.
